# Sonar

Sonar is a basic one-page property-search app built in javascript.

So far I implemented models for property unit and list of properties, views for list of properties and single property and a controller that instantiates a property based on search criteria.  

The app can be seen here: https://sonarpea.herokuapp.com/   

##### If I have more time, I would like to:
- make the app connect to an API to get actual property data.  
- make app actually utilise the form and filter the search results.  
- display property descriptions and photos.  

To run the app locally:
- download or clone this repo.  
- install dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```
- start the server:
```
node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
```
- go to http://localhost:8080/
